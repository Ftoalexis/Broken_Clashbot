# Broken_Clashbot
Modification of v5.8 of bot originally available from http://clashbot.org/forums/index.php?/topic/1010-flawless-clashbot-release-58-recommended/

## File not included
curl.exe is not included here to avoid risk of potential virus or malicious file.

You need a file called "curl.exe" that runs a program called cURL and put this file in ScriptDir\curl\

### Reference
For your convenience, and referring to pushbullet's document:
https://docs.pushbullet.com/

curl can be find in below location
