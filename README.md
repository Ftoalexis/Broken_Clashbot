### File not included
curl.exe is not included here to avoid risk of potential virus or malicious file. If you want to use pushbullet for notifications you need to download this.

You need a file called "curl.exe" that runs a program called cURL and put this file in ScriptDir\curl\
curl can be found at: http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
